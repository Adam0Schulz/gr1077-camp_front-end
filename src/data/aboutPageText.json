  "p1": "CAMP encompasses researchers in the Department of Anthropology who analyse the cultural, religious, economic, policy and gendered dimensions of power relations; and the political aspects of cultural, religious, social, economic and other processes.",
  "p2": "‘’Highlighting the pervasiveness of power, mobility and cultural contestations in our ethnographic locations’’",
  "p3": "In general, we study classifications and power differences implicit in social relationships and in their cultural representations and enactments, along with their historical, temporal, spatial and institutional effects. We are concerned with the ways in which communities engage with nationalism, ethnicity and migratory and transnational networks",
  "p4": "Our cluster provides rich empirical and theoretical grounding as brought out in its publications, and creates intellectual and experiential resources for broad-based teaching themes in the department.\n\nCAMP’s research and teaching practices contribute towards planning student careers in academia, development, humanitarian work, state and local governance, international diplomacy, governmental and non-governmental organisations, cultural and research institutes, transnational advocacy and consultancies, among others.\n\nThe group has several individual and collective research projects as well as centres.",
